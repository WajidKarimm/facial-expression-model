# facial-expression-model
This project used a VGG16-based deep learning model to classify facial expressions with 91% accuracy on the ExpW dataset. Future work focuses on improving generalization for real-world applications.
# Expression Classification from Facial Images

This project aims to classify facial expressions into seven categories (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral) using a deep learning model based on VGG16. The system leverages the ExpW dataset to train and evaluate its performance, with potential applications in emotion analysis, human-computer interaction, and psychological research.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to identify human emotions from facial images. The model was trained using a subset of 36,000 images from the ExpW dataset and achieved a test accuracy of **91%**. It employs the VGG16 architecture with custom classification layers and is fine-tuned for the task of facial expression recognition.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Expression in the Wild (ExpW)
- **Total Images:** 91,793
- **Categories:** Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- **Data Division:**
  - Training Set: 70%
  - Validation Set: 10%
  - Test Set: 20%

The dataset was preprocessed by resizing images and normalizing pixel values for optimal training.

## Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Custom Layers:**
  - Fully connected layers for classification
  - Softmax activation for output probabilities
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy

### Key Components
- **Convolutional Layers:** Feature extraction from input images.
- **Pooling Layers:** Spatial dimension reduction for computational efficiency.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Mapping features to output categories.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Epochs:** 10

Hyperparameter optimization was performed using grid search to identify the most effective settings.

## Results
- **Training Accuracy:** 98%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 92%
- **Test Accuracy:** 91%

The model demonstrates strong performance in recognizing facial expressions but requires further fine-tuning to improve generalization.
